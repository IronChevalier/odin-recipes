# odin-recipes
First Odin Project :)

<!-- 

This project is tasking me to build a simple website. I will be using my newly gained knowledge and skills to:

- Create basic !DOCTYPE HTML boilerplate from memory. 
- Add links and images through anchors (<a> href) and (<img src>) respectively.
- Proper usage of lists 
- Proper and clean commits through GIT version control, and pushing it all into 
  a GitHub repository. 

The simple website will contain a title, a homepage, links to multiple pages containing recipes, its steps, ingredients, and pictures of the different foods.
